# Model Openness Tool

This directory contains a Jupyter Notebook for generating model information using the Granite model locally.
The motivation behind this project is to develop a reliable and consistent AI agent as an alternative to commercial AI models.
The current code is a work in progress and experimental.
The main objective is to create a fundamental AI agent that can later serve as the foundation for integration and deployment on the MOT website.
