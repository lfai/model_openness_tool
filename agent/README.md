# Introduction and instructions

We are creating an agent that will update the Model Openness Tool.  
We're starting by running the prompt manually to make sure that it works.

To test, run these prompts in order:

1. Setup prompt (setup-prompt.md)
2. Instructions prompt (instruction-prompt.md)
3. Model request prompt (the name of the model, such as "DeepSeek-R1")
