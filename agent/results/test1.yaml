  **Sources and Mapping:**

  -   **framework.date** (the date of filling the form): set to today’s date, May 25 2025.
      
  -   **release.name** “DeepSeek-V3” and **version** “671B” come from the GitHub model summary, which states 671B total parameters [GitHub](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3).
      
  -   **release.date** “2024-12-27” is the publication date of the DeepSeek-V3 technical report on arXiv [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19437?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
      
  -   **release.license** “MIT” is pulled from the repository’s code license listing on GitHub [GitHub](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3).
      
  -   **release.type** “language” is the model’s category as an LLM.
      
  -   **release.architecture** is described in the repo introduction, specifying MoE with MLA and DeepSeekMoE [GitHub](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3).
      
  -   **release.origin** is marked “research,” reflecting that DeepSeek-V3 was developed by DeepSeek AI’s research team.
      
  -   **release.producer** “DeepSeek AI” is the GitHub organization and company behind the model [GitHub](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3).
      
  -   **release.contact** “service@deepseek.com” is cited from the Hugging Face model page’s contact section for DeepSeek-V3-0324 [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
      
  -   **release.repository** is the GitHub URL for DeepSeek-V3 [GitHub](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3).
      
  -   **release.huggingface** is taken from the GitHub downloads table linking to Hugging Face [GitHub](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3).
      
  -   **Components & licenses**:
      
      -   Code components (architecture, inference code, supporting libraries, metadata) carry the MIT license as shown in the repo’s LICENSE-CODE file [GitHub](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3).
          
      -   **Model parameters** use the custom “LICENSE-MODEL” defined in the repository’s LICENSE-MODEL file [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3/blob/main/LICENSE-MODEL?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
          
      -   **Evaluation data**, **model card**, and **evaluation results** are marked “unlicensed” following the example pattern when no explicit license is provided.
          
      -   **Technical report** and **research paper** both fall under ArXiv’s perpetual non-exclusive license, as indicated on the arXiv page [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19437?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

comments: |
  This is reasonably close but doesn't include a Global license.  It also mistakes the license file name for the license name.
