Excellent.  Now I want you to analyze an open source model.  Do any research you have to answer all of these questions about the model and fill out the YAML document.  If you don't know the answer, look it up online. DO NOT MAKE ANYTHING UP.  Output the full YAML document, then follow up with an explanation of where you found each piece of information.  This task is very important to my career.  

Do you understand?
